# Documentation: Options Configuration

Detailed information on how to customize the `options.yaml` for each Pooled Cell Painting experiment.  

For more information on `.yaml`, read the [YAML page on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

Structure is very important in `.yaml` files.
When editing the `.yaml` make sure to maintain dashes and indentations.
(When information is added on the same line, it makes a dictionary where the value is a string.
When there are multiple lines, the value is a list with string elements.)

## core:  

`compartments:` *The cellular compartments identified as objects in the cell painting experiment.  
Default cell painting compartments are:  
e.g.*  
    - Cells  
    - Nuclei  
    - Cytoplasm  

`cell_quality:`  
`categorize_cell_quality:` *The cell categorization method you would like to use. The methods are described in cell_quality_utils.py in the Pooled Cell Painting Profiling Recipe.  
e.g.* simple  
*e.g.* simple_plus  
`cell_filter:`*Select the categories of cells that you wish to use for analysis. Categories are defined in cell_quality_utils.py in the Pooled Cell Painting Profiling Recipe.
Make sure that the options you set here are available in the categorize_cell_quality method that you set above in core config.  
e.g.*  
    - Perfect  
    - Great  
`cell_quality_column:` *The column that contains the numerical cell quality category.  
e.g.* Metadata_Foci_Cell_Quality  
`cell_quality_index:` *The column that contains info on how to rename the index in the cell quality dataframe.  
e.g.* Metadata_Foci_Cell_Quality_Index

`cell_id_cols:` *All columns necessary for parsing objects.
Objects in CellProfiler are identified and numbered on a per-image basis so both image number and object number are needed to parse objects.  
e.g.*  
     - ImageNumber  
     - ObjectNumber

`cell_match_cols:` *Enter every parent object/s for every compartment listed in compartments above (you may need to add additional key pairs for additional compartments identified beyond the default).
Parent refers to relationship in order of identification.
Generally, nuclei are identified first so they do not have parents.
The parent columns can be found by searching the Compartment.csv files for columns following the format "Parent_Compartment."*  
`cells:` *Generally, nuclei are used to identify cells as a secondary object so the only parent object a cell will have is nuclei.  
e.g.*   
    - Parent_Nuclei  
`cytoplasm:` *Cytoplasm is generally a tertiary object identified by subtracting nuclei from cells so its parent objects are nuclei and cells.  
e.g.*  
    - Parent_Nuclei  
    - Parent_Cells  
`spots:` *Spots are generally labeled on a per-cell basis.  
e.g.*  
    - Parent_Cells  

`compression:` *Compression to use when creating .csv files. For more information and options, see Pandas DataFrame.to_csv documentation.
e.g.* gzip

`float_format` *Decimal precision to use in writing output files. For more information and options, see Python string formatting documentation. Default* "%.5g" *keeps 5 decimal places.  
e.g.* "%.5g"

`ignore_files:`*Ignore any files with these names.
List the complete file name.
Default is* .DS_Store *because Macs make hidden files with that name.  
e.g.*  
    - .DS_Store
